# Build a Kubernetes cluster using k3s via Ansible

Author: <https://github.com/itwars>

## K3s Ansible Playbook

Build a Kubernetes cluster using Ansible with k3s. The goal is easily install a Kubernetes cluster on machines running:

- [X] Debian
- [X] Ubuntu
- [X] CentOS

on processor architecture:

- [X] x64
- [X] arm64
- [X] armhf

## System requirements

Deployment environment must have Ansible 2.4.0+
Master and nodes must have passwordless SSH access

## Usage

First copy the sample inventory to `inventory.yml`.

```bash
cp inventory-sample.yml inventory.yml
```

Second edit the inventory file to match your cluster setup. For example:
```bash
k3s_cluster:
  children:
    server:
      hosts:
        192.16.35.11
    agent:
      hosts:
        192.16.35.12
        192.16.35.13
```

If needed, you can also edit `vars` section at the bottom to match your environment.

If multiple hosts are in the server group the playbook will automatically setup k3s in HA mode with embedded etcd.
An odd number of server nodes is recommended (3,5,7). Read the offical documentation below for more information and options.

Using a loadbalancer or VIP as the API endpoint is preferred but not covered here.


Start provisioning of the cluster using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook/site.yml -i inventory.yml
```

## Kubeconfig

To get access to your **Kubernetes** cluster just

```bash
scp debian@server_ip:~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config
```
